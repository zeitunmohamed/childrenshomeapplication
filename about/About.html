<h3>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</h3>
<p>Najah Childrenâ€™s Home is an orphanage with humble inception that was registered by the Registrar General of the Societies SOC/1984, Registration No 11520 of 18th January 1986. The founding fathers were moved by the increasing number of needy Muslim orphans that were languishing in poverty with no care and no hope as the area had only one orphanage and could not cater for all the orphans. They pulled their resources together and rent some few rooms in a residential premises in Garissa town and admitted the first batch of 60 orphans.
The founders were well- visioned and acquired land in 1989 for the institution in the Iftin Location of Garissa County for they were quite optimistic that someday the institution would grow.</p>
